# Evaluation

## Prerequisites
    ```{r, message=FALSE}
    library(rlang)
    library(purrr)
    ```

## Evaluation Basics

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Carefully read the documentation for `source()`. What environment does it use by default? What if you supply `local = TRUE`? How do you provide a custom argument?
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: By default, `source()` uses the global environment, but another evaluation environment may also be chosen, by passing it to the `local`-argument. To use a local environment set `local = TRUE`.
    
    ```{r}
    # create temporary, sourcable R script
    tmp_file <- tempfile()
    writeLines("print(x)", tmp_file)
    
    # set x globally
    x <- "global environment"
    env2 <- rlang::env(x = "specified envirionment")
    
    locate_evaluation <- function(file, local){
      x <- "local environment"
      source(file, local = local)
    }
    
    # where will source() be evaluated?
    locate_evaluation(tmp_file, local = FALSE)  # default
    locate_evaluation(tmp_file, local = env2)
    locate_evaluation(tmp_file, local = TRUE)
    ```

2. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Predict the results of the following lines of code:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    eval(quote(eval(quote(eval(quote(2 + 2))))))
    eval(eval(quote(eval(quote(eval(quote(2 + 2)))))))
    quote(eval(quote(eval(quote(eval(quote(2 + 2))))))) 
    ```

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: You can see the output of the code above here:

    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    eval(quote(eval(quote(eval(quote(2 + 2))))))
    eval(eval(quote(eval(quote(eval(quote(2 + 2)))))))
    quote(eval(quote(eval(quote(eval(quote(2 + 2)))))))
    ```

   Generally, `2 + 2` is first quoted as an expression and than evaluated to `4`. When we nest calls to `quote()` and `eval()` more calls will be added to the AST, but the pattern of quoting and evaluating stays the same.

    ```{r}
    # pattern: evaluate a quoted expression
    eval(quote(
      eval(quote(
        eval(quote(
          2 + 2))
      ))
    ))
    
    lobstr::ast(eval(quote(eval(quote(eval(quote(2 + 2)))))))
    ```

   When we wrap this expression in another `eval()` the `4` will be evaluated once more, but the result doesn't change. When we quote it, no evaluation takes place and we capture the expression instead.

3. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Fill in the function bodies below to re-implement `get()` using `sym()` and `eval()`, and`assign()` using `sym()`, `expr()`, and `eval()`. Don't worry about the multiple ways of choosing an environment that `get()` and `assign()` support; assume that the user supplies it explicitly

    ```{r}
    # name is a string
    get2 <- function(name, env) {}
    assign2 <- function(name, value, env) {}
    ```

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: The reimplemantion of these two function using tidy evaluation is based on building an expression, which is then evaluated.

    ```{r}
    get2 <- function(name, env = caller_env()) {
      name_sym <- sym(name)
      eval(name_sym, env)
    }
    
    x <- 1
    get2("x")
    ```

   The implementation could be even more concise, if the user would provide an expression instead of a string:

    ```{r}
    get3 <- function(name, env = caller_env()){
      eval(name, env)
    }
    
    get3(x)
    ```

   To build the correct expression for the value assignment, we unquote using `!!`. Bang bang! :)

    ```{r}
    assign2 <- function(name, value, env = caller_env()) {
      name_sym <- sym(name)
      assign_expr <- expr(!!name_sym <- !!value)
      eval(assign_expr, env)
    }
    
    assign2("x", 4)
    x
    ```
    
4. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Modify `source2()` so it returns the result of _every_ expression, not just the last one. Can you eliminate the for loop?

   __<span style="color:orange">A</span>__: 

   - keep in mind `<-` invisibly returns its value

    ```{r, error=TRUE}
    tmp_file <- tempfile()
    writeLines("x <- 1
            x
            y <- 2
            y  # another comment
           ", tmp_file)
    
    source2 <- function(file, env = caller_env()){
      readLines(file) %>% 
        parse_exprs() %>%
        map(eval_tidy, env = env)
      
      # alternatively: 
      # for (i in seq_along(exprs)) eval(exprs[i], env)
    }
    
    source2(tmp_file)
    x
    y
    ```

5. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: The code generated by `source2()` lacks source references. Read the source code for `sys.source()` and the help for `srcfilecopy()`, then modify `source2()` to preserve source references. You can test your code by sourcing a function that contains a comment. If successful, when you look at the function, you'll see the comment and not just the source code.

   __<span style="color:orange">A</span>__: 

    ```{r, error=TRUE}
    tmp_file <- tempfile()
    writeLines('x <- 1
    test_function <- function() {
    "source me!"  # testcomment
    }', tmp_file)
    
    file <- tmp_file
    
    source2 <- function(file, env = caller_env()){
      lines <- readLines(file)
      srcfile <- srcfilecopy(file, lines)
      
      parse(text = lines, srcfile = srcfile, keep.source = TRUE) %>% 
        map(eval_tidy, env = env) 
    }
    
    source2(tmp_file)
    test_function
    ```

   - the comment is still missing

6. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: We can make `base::local()` slightly easier to understand by spreading it out over multiple lines:

    ```{r}
    local3 <- function(expr, envir = new.env()) {
      call <- substitute(eval(quote(expr), envir))
      eval(call, envir = parent.frame())
    }
    ```
    
  Explain how `local()` works in words. (Hint: you might want to `print(call)` to help understand what `substitute()` is doing, and read the documentation to remind yourself what environment `new.env()` will inherit from.)

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__:

```{r}
local3 <- function(expr, envir = new.env()) {
  call <- substitute(eval(quote(expr), envir))
  print(call)
  eval(call, envir = parent.frame())
}

foo <- local3({
  x <- 10
  x * 2
})

foo
```

substitute only replaces the expr with the input and the environment (for the call to eval) by the relate

```{r}
# how does substitute work?
```

- substitute opperates in function execution environment, it replaces the variables bound in this environments by their expression (expr becomes the input, and envir, becomes the environment passed to `local3` (new.env() by default))

<!-- this needs a better description based on the ast, @taz -->

```{r}
# this is, what is happening afterwards
eval(eval(quote({x <- 10; x * 2}), new.env()), parent.frame())

eval(quote({x <- 10; x * 2}), new.env())  # this is evaluated locally

eval(20, parent.frame())  # makes it available in the caller environment
```


## Quosures

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Predict what evaluating each of the following quosures will return.

    ```{r}
    library(rlang)
    
    q1 <- new_quosure(expr(x), env(x = 1))
    q1
    
    q2 <- new_quosure(expr(x + !!q1), env(x = 10))
    q2
    
    q3 <- new_quosure(expr(x + !!q2), env(x = 100))
    q3
    ```
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: Each quosure will be evaluated in it's own environment. This leads us to:
    
    ```{r}
    eval_tidy(q1)
    eval_tidy(q2)
    eval_tidy(q3)
    ```

2. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Write an enenv() function that captures the environment associated with an argument. (Hint: this should only require two function calls.)

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: A quosure captures both the expression and the environment. From a captured quosure, we can access the environment with the help of `get_env()`.

    ```{r}
    enenv <- function(x){
      q <- enquo(x)
      get_env(q) 
    }
    
    # Test
    capture_env <- function(x){
      enenv(x)
    }
    
    enenv(x)
    capture_env(x)  # functions execution environment is captured
    ```

## Data Masks
1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Why did I use a for loop in `transform2()` instead of `map()`? Consider `transform2(df, x = x * 2, x = x * 2)`.
   
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: Within the `for`-loop the evaluation of previous steps has already been assigned to `.data`, which makes the specification of chained transformations possible.

    ```{r}
    transform2 <- function(.data, ...) {
      dots <- enquos(...)
      
      for (i in seq_along(dots)) {
        name <- names(dots)[[i]]
        dot <- dots[[i]]
        
        .data[[name]] <- eval_tidy(dot, .data)
      }
      
      .data
    }
    
    df <- data.frame(x = 1)
    transform2(df, x = x * 2, x = x * 2)  # (re-)transforms x
    transform2(df, x1 = x * 2, x2 = x1 * 2)  # stores intermediate variables
    ```

   We see, that the computation `(x * 2) * 2` has been taking place - the output of the first transformation has been used as input for the second transformation. 
   This feature is not available, with `map()`, becaus it evaluates each element of the input seperately. This implies, that the individual transformations are independent of another and that intermediate computations are not available for the subsequent transformations.

    ```{r, error=TRUE}
    transform3 <- function(.data, ...) {
      dots <- enquos(...)
      
      dots %>% 
        map(eval_tidy, .data) %>% 
        dplyr::bind_cols(.data, .)
    }
    
    transform3(df, x = x * 2, x = x * 2)  # bind_cols() corrects duplicate names
    transform3(df, x1 = x * 2, x2 = x1 * 2)
    ```

   The repeated retransformation of columns is very useful in interactive data analysis and can also be used within `dplyr::mutate()`. Be a little careful with reusing the same name too often though, because this spreads out related transformations across multiple statements.

2. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Here's an alternative implementation of `subset2()`:

    ```{r, results = FALSE}
    subset3 <- function(data, rows) {
      rows <- enquo(rows)
      eval_tidy(expr(data[!!rows, , drop = FALSE]), data = data)
    }

    df <- data.frame(x = 1:3)
    subset3(df, x == 1)
    ```

   Compare and contrast `subset3()` to `subset2()`. What are its advantages and disadvantages?

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: Let's take a closer look at subset2() first:
   
```{r}
subset2 <- function(data, rows) {
  rows <- enquo(rows)
  rows_val <- eval_tidy(rows, data)
  stopifnot(is.logical(rows_val))

  data[rows_val, , drop = FALSE]
}
```

We see, that there is an additional logical check, which is missing from `subset3()`. The here the logical condition `rows` is evaluated in the context of `data`, which results in a logical vector used for subsetting. Afterwards only `[` needs to be used to return the subset.

```{r}
# subset2() evaluation
(rows_val <- eval_tidy(quo(x == 1), df))
df[rows_val, , drop = FALSE]
```

With `subset3()` both of these steps occur in a single line. This means, that the subsetting is also evaluated in the context of the data mask.

```{r}
# subset3() evaluation
eval_tidy(expr(df[x == 1, ,drop = FALSE]), df)
```

This is shorter, but also less readable, because the evaluation and the subsetting take place in the same expression. It may also introduce unwanted errors, if the data mask should contain an element named `data`, because the object from the data mask takes precedence over argument of the function.

```{r, error=TRUE}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3, data = 1)
subset2(df, x == 1)
subset3(df, x == 1)
```

<!-- is there an advantage of `subset3()`, that I am missing? -->

3. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: The following function implements the basics of `dplyr::arrange()`. Annotate each line with a comment explaining what it does. Can you explain why `!!.na.last` is strictly correct, but omitting the `!!` is unlikely to cause problems?

    ```{r}
    arrange2 <- function(.df, ..., .na.last = TRUE) {
      args <- enquos(...)

      order_call <- expr(order(!!!args, na.last = !!.na.last))

      ord <- eval_tidy(order_call, .df)
      stopifnot(length(ord) == nrow(.df))

      .df[ord, , drop = FALSE]
    }
    ```

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: This function builds an expression, which contains the specified `order()`-call. The `!!!`-operator is used, which allows multiple arguments to be included (to break ties). Once the correct roworder is determined, numeric subsetting is used to return the rearranged data frame.

    ```{r}
    arrange2 <- function(.df, ..., .na.last = TRUE) {
      args <- enquos(...)  # capture arguments, which determine order
      
      order_call <- expr(order(!!!args, na.last = !!.na.last))
      # `!!!`: unquote-splice arguments into order()
      # `!!.na.last`: pass option for treatment of NAs to order()
      # return expression-object

      ord <- eval_tidy(order_call, .df)    # evaluate order_call within .df
      stopifnot(length(ord) == nrow(.df))  # ensure that no rows are dropped

      .df[ord, , drop = FALSE]  # reorder rows by numeric subsetting
    }
    ```

   By using `!!.na.last` the `.na.last`-argument is unquoted, when the `order()`-call is built. That way, the `na.last`-argeument is already correctly specified (typically `TRUE`, `FALSE` or `NA`).

   Without the unquoting, the expression would read `na.last = .na.last`. The value for `.na.last` would still have to be looked up and found. Because these computations take place inside of the functions execution environment (which contains `.na.last`), this is unlikely to cause problems.

    ```{r}
    # the effect of unquoting .na.last
    .na.last <- FALSE
    expr(order(..., na.last = !!.na.last))
    expr(order(..., na.last = .na.last))
    ```

   PS: Putting breakpoints (`browser()`) inside these functions was really helpful to figure out, what's going on inside of them.

## Using tidy evaluation
1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__:  I've included an alternative implementation of `threshold_var()` below. What makes it different to the approach I used above? What makes it harder?

    ```{r}
    threshold_var2 <- function(df, var, val) {
      var <- ensym(var)
      subset2(df, `$`(.data, !!var) >= !!val)
    }
    ```

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: 

## Old exercises

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Run this code in your head and predict what it will print. Confirm or refute your prediction by running the code in R.

    ```{r, results = FALSE}
    f <- function(...) {
      x <- "f"
      g(f = x, ...)
    }
    g <- function(...) {
      x <- "g"
      h(g = x, ...)
    }
    h <- function(...) {
      enquos(...)
    }
    x <- "top"
    
    out <- f(top = x)
    out
    purrr::map_chr(out, eval_tidy)
    ```

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What happens if you use `expr()` instead of `enexpr()` inside of `subset2()`?


1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Improve `subset2()` to make it more like real `base::subset()`:
    
   * Drop rows where `subset` evaluates to `NA`
   * Give a clear error message if `subset` doesn't yield a logical vector
   * What happens if `subset` yields a vector that's not the same as the number of rows in `data`? What do you think should happen?
      
2. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: The third argument in `base::subset()` allows you to select variables. It treats variable names as if they were positions. This allows you to do things like `subset(mtcars, , -cyl)` to drop the cylinder variable, or `subset(mtcars, , disp:drat)` to select all the variables between `disp` and `drat`. How does this work? I've made this easier to understand by extracting it out into its own function that uses tidy evaluation.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    select <- function(df, vars) {
      vars <- enexpr(vars)
      var_pos <- set_names(as.list(seq_along(df)), names(df))
      
      cols <- eval_tidy(vars, var_pos)
      df[, cols, drop = FALSE]
    }
    select(mtcars, -cyl)
    ```
    
3. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Here's an alternative implementation of `arrange()`:

    ```{r}
    invoke <- function(fun, ...) do.call(fun, dots_list(...))
    arrange3 <- function(.data, ..., .na.last = TRUE) {
      args <- enquos(...)
      
      ords <- purrr::map(args, eval_tidy, data = .data)
      ord <- invoke(order, !!!ords, na.last = .na.last)
      
      .data[ord, , drop = FALSE]
    }
    ```
    
   Describe the primary difference in approach compared to the function defined in the text. 
    
   One advantage of this approach is that you could check each element of `...` to make sure that input is correct. What property should each element of `ords` have?

4. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Here's an alternative implementation of `subset2()`: 

    ```{r}
    subset3 <- function(data, rows) {
      eval_tidy(quo(data[!!enquo(rows), , drop = FALSE]), data = data)
    }
    ```
    
   Use intermediate variables to make the function easier to understand, then
   explain how this approach differs to the approach in the text.

5. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Implement a form of `arrange()` where you can request a variable to sorted in descending order using named arguments:
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    arrange(mtcars, cyl, desc = mpg, vs)
    ```
    
   (Hint:  The `descreasing` argument to `order()` will not help you. Instead, look at the definition of `dplyr::desc()`, and read the help for `xtfrm()`.)

6. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Why do you not need to worry about ambiguous argument names with `...` in
    `arrange()`? Why is it a good idea to use the `.` prefix anyway?

7. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What does `transform()` do? Read the documentation. How does it work?
   Read the source code for `transform.data.frame()`. What does `substitute(list(...))` do?
   
8. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Use tidy evaluation to implement your own version of `transform()`. 
   Extend it so that a calculation can refer to variables created by transform, i.e. make this work:
    
    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    df <- data.frame(x = 1:3)
    transform(df, x1 = x + 1, x2 = x1 + 1)
    ```

9. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What does `with()` do? How does it work? Read the source code for `with.default()`. What does `within()` do? How does it work? Read the source code for `within.data.frame()`. Why is the code so much more
    complex than `with()`?
   
10. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Implement a version of `within.data.frame()` that uses tidy evaluation. 
    Read the documentation and make sure that you understand what `within()` does, then read the source code.
    
<!-- ## Wrapping quoting functions -->

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: When model building, typically the response and data are relatively constant while you rapidly experiment with different predictors. Write a small wrapper that allows you to reduce duplication in this situation.
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    pred_mpg <- function(resp, ...) {
      
    }
    pred_mpg(~ disp)
    pred_mpg(~ I(1 / disp))
    pred_mpg(~ disp * cyl)
    ```
    
2. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Another way to way to write `boot_lm()` would be to include the boostrapping expression (`data[sample(nrow(data), replace = TRUE), , drop = FALSE]`) in the data argument. Implement that approach. What are the advantages? What are the disadvantages?

3. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: To make these functions somewhat more robust, instead of always using the `caller_env()` we could capture a quosure, and then use its environment. However, if there are multiple arguments, they might be associated with different environments. Write a function that takes a list of quosures, and returns the common environment, if they have one, or otherwise throws an error.

4. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Write a function that takes a data frame and a list of formulas, fitting a linear model with each formula, generating a useful model call.

5. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Create a formula generation function that allows you to optionally supply a transformation function (e.g. `log()`) to the response or the predictors.
