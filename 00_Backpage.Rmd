# Advanced R Solutions
“I learned a lot working through their solutions — it's a great way to broaden and deepen your
understanding of R. (I should probably go through it again...)”
- Greg Wilson, RStudio

This book offers solutions to all 284 exercises in ___Advanced R, Second Edition___. All the solutions have been
carefully documented, and made to be as clear and accessible as possible. Working through the
exercises and their solutions will give you a deeper understanding of a variety of programming
challenges, many of which are relevant to everyday work. This will expand your set of tools on a
technical and conceptual level. You will be able to transfer many of the specific programming schemes
directly, and will discover far more elegant solutions to everyday problems.

Features:
* When R creates copies, and how it affects memory usage and code performance
* Everything you could ever want to know about functions
* The differences between calling and exiting handlers
* How to employ functional programming to solve modular tasks
* The motivation, mechanics, usage, and limitations of R's highly pragmatic S3 OO system
* The R6 OO system, which is more like OO programming in other languages
* The rules that R uses to parse and evaluate expressions
* How to use metaprogramming to generate HTML or LaTeX with elegant R code
* How to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks

Malte Grosser is a business mathematician from Hamburg, who has been programming in R regularly
since the beginning of his career. He is currently finishing his PhD on machine learning for stroke
outcome prediction and develops solutions in business as a data scientist.

Henning Bumann is a psychologist and statistician who enjoys making sense of data and is motivated to
build data-driven solutions that are beautiful and meaningful. He prefers free programming tools to
support effective and transparent collaboration.

Hadley Wickham is Chief Scientist at RStudio, an Adjunct Professor at Stanford University and the
University of Auckland, and a member of the R Foundation. He is the lead developer of the tidyverse, a
collection of R packages, including ggplot2 and dplyr, designed to support data science.
