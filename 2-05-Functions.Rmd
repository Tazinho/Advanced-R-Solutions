# Functions

## Function fundamentals

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Given a name, like `"mean"`, `match.fun()` lets you find a function. Given a function, can you find its name? Why doesn't that make sense in R?  

   __<span style="color:orange">A</span>__: If you know `body()`, `formals()` and `environment()` it can be possible to find the function. However, this approach won't be work for primitive functions, because they return `NULL` for these three properties. Also annonymous functions won't be found, because they are not bound to a name. It is also possible that different names in an environment contain bindings to one (or more functions) with the same `body()`, `formals()` and `environment()` properties. This means that the search wouldn't be unique <!-- eindeutig -->.

   More general: A (function) name is always bound to an object, but an object (i.e. a function) doesn't have a name (just a binding sometimes). <!-- @hb: look this up again -->
   
   Also: You "can only find the parents of an environment, not its children, so this is necessarily only going to be a partial search" (Hadley Wickham). This means, that some function names in child environments will not be found. <!-- check this. -->

2. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: It’s possible (although typically not useful) to call an anonymous function. Which of the two approaches below is correct? Why?
   
    ```{r}
    function(x) 3()
    (function(x) 3)()
    ```

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: The second approach is correct. In this approach the anonymous function `function(x) 3` is surrounded by a pair of brackets and followed by `()` which calls the former `(function(x) 3)`. The extra syntax is needed as otherwise the following `()` belong to the body of the anonymous function. Therefore, the expression in the first approach returns a function with the invalid body `3()` and we get an error when we call it:
   
    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    (function(x) 3())()
    ```
   
3. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: A good rule of thumb is that an anonymous function should fit on one line and shouldn't need to use `{}`. Review your code. Where could you have used an anonymous function instead of a named function? Where should you have used a named function instead of an anonymous function?  
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: The use of anonymous functions may lead to more concise and elegant code in certain situations. However, they miss a descriptive name and it can take a while to figure out what they do. That's why it's really helpful to give long and complex functions a descriptive name. You may take a look at your own projects (or some other online projects) to reflect your own style.

<!-- @hb: maybe describe advantages of anonymous functions more clearly. -->

4. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What function allows you to tell if an object is a function? What function allows you to tell if a function is a primitive function?
       
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: To find out, if an object is a function `is.function()` can be used. To specifically check, if an object is a primitive function use `is.primitive()`.

5. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: This code makes a list of all functions in the base package. 
    
    ```{r}
    objs <- mget(ls("package:base", all = TRUE), inherits = TRUE)
    funs <- Filter(is.function, objs)
    ```
    
   Use it to answer the following questions:
    
   a. Which base function has the most arguments?
    
   a. How many base functions have no arguments? What's special about those functions?
   
   a. How could you adapt the code to find all primitive functions?  
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: Let's look at each subquestion seperately:
   
   a. To find the function with the most arguments, we pipe the list of functions into a chain of iterations. First, we create a list of each function's arguments. Then we count the arguments for each function. Finally, we subset the result with its maximum element, returning us the name of the function with the most arguments and the corresponding number of arguments:
   
      ```{r}
      library(magrittr)
      
      funs %>% 
        sapply(formals) %>%
        lengths() %>% 
        `[`(which.max(.))
      ```
      
   b. To find the number of 0-argument functions, we count the number of arguments again for each function. However, this time we check each count for beeing equal to `0` and sum up the result.
   
      ```{r}
      funs %>% sapply(formals) %>% 
        lengths() %>%
        `==`(0L) %>%
        sum()
      ```
     As we already know from the textbook that `formals()` returns `NULL` for primitive functions, all of them are included in our count of 0-argument functions. To check how this affects our count, let's create a table of 0-argument functions, dividing them into primitive and non-primitive functions. Therefore, we filter the function list for 0-argument functions first. Then we check each of these functions for beeing primitive or not and finally create our table:
     
      ```{r}
      funs %>%
        Filter(function(x) length(formals(x)) == 0, .) %>% 
        sapply(is.primitive) %>% 
        table()
      ```
     Indeed, most of the 0-argument functions in base R are primitive functions.
     
   c. To adapt the code in `Filter()` to find all primitive functions, we can simply change the predicate from `is.function()` to `is.primitive()`:
   
      ```{r, eval = FALSE}
      funs <- Filter(is.primitive, objs)
      ```
      
6. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What are the three important components of a function?  
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: Thse components are the function's `body()`, `formals()` and `environment()`. However, as mentioned in the textbook:
    
   > There is one exception to the rule that functions have three components. Primitive functions, like `sum()`, call C code directly with `.Primitive()` and contain no R code. Therefore their `formals()`, `body()`, and `environment()` are all `NULL`.

7. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: When does printing a function not show what environment it was created in?  

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: When it is a primitive function or when it was created in the global environment.

## Lexical Scoping

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What does the following code return? Why? Describe how each of the three `c`’s is interpreted.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    c <- 10
    c(c = c)
    ```  
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: A named vector `c`, which first element has the value `10` and the name `"c"`. The first "c" is the `c()` function, the second is the name of the first element and the third is the value of the first element.
       
2. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What are the four principles that govern how R looks for values?  
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: The four principles are those behind R's implementation of lexical scoping:
   
   * name masking
   * functions vs. variables
   * a fresh start
   * dynamic lookup

3. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What does the following function return? Make a prediction before running the code yourself.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    f <- function(x) {
      f <- function(x) {
        f <- function(x) {
          x ^ 2
        }
        f(x) + 1
      }
      f(x) * 2
    }
    f(10)
    ```
        
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: 202
      
## Lazy evaluation

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What important property of `&&` makes `x_ok()` work?

    ```{r}
    x_ok <- function(x) {
      !is.null(x) && length(x) == 1 && x > 0
    }
    
    x_ok(NULL)
    x_ok(1)
    x_ok(1:3)
    ```

   What is different with this code? Why is this behaviour undesirable here?
       
    ```{r}
    x_ok <- function(x) {
      !is.null(x) & length(x) == 1 & x > 0
    }
    
    x_ok(NULL)
    x_ok(1)
    x_ok(1:3)
    ```
    
    __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: The intended usage of `x_ok()` is to check if an argument provided to a function is not `NULL`, has length `1` and is greater than `0`. To work with this function, we only want to know if this is `TRUE`, `FALSE` or `NA` (unknown). Therefore, the first version behaves as desired. The property of `&&` that makes `x_ok()` work is lazy evaluation.
    
    To highlight the relevant consequences of lazy evaluation for this example, let's look at the provided test cases and compare both versions of `x_ok()` for each of them.
    
    - **`x = NULL`:** As `is.null(x)` returns `FALSE` also `&&()` returns `FALSE`. Because of lazy evaluation the other arguments of `&&()` are not even evaluated. This makes sense as when one part of a logical AND conjunction is `FALSE`, the whole logical conjunction must be `FALSE`. In contrast the `&()` function evaluates all of its arguments. Especially as the last part of `x_ok()`, `x > 0`, evaluates to `logical(0)`, it becomes relevant how the results are combined. As `&()` combines `FALSE` and `logical(0)` to `logical(0)` the `&`-version of `x_ok()` doesn't provide a desired result in this case.
    
    - **`x = 1`:** As all statements evaluate to `TRUE`. Both versions of `x_ok()` combine these into the desired output of `TRUE`.
    
    - **`x = 1:3`:** When it comes to elementwise evaluation `&&()` and `&()` differ fundamentally. While `&&()` compares only the first elements of its arguments, `&()` compares its arguments elementwise and even recycles shorter vectors, if necessary. As the `length(x) == 1` condition is `FALSE`, the `&&`-version of `x_ok()` doesn't even evaluate the last condition, `x > 0`, and returns `FALSE` immediately. In contrast, the `&`-version evaluates all of its arguments and since `x > 0` evaluates to `c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)`, this is also the result (due to recycling and elementwise comparison), which is - again - not as desired.

2. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What does this function return? Why? Which principle does it illustrate?

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    f2 <- function(x = z) {
      z <- 100
      x
    }
    f2()
    ```  
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: The function returns `100`. This is because default arguments are evaluated in the function environment and arguments are not evaluated before they are accessed. At the time `x` is accessed `z` has already been bound to the value `100`. The illustrated principle is lazy evaluation.
    
3. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What does this function return? Why? Which principle does it illustrate?
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    y <- 10
    f1 <- function(x = {y <- 1; 2}, y = 0) {
      c(x, y)
    }
    f1()
    y
    ```  
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: The function returns `c(2, 1)`. This is due to name masking. When `x` gets accessed within `c()`, the promise `x = {y <- 1; 2}` gets evaluated inside `f1()`'s environment. `y` gets the value `1` assigned and the return value of `{()` (`2`) is assigned to `x`. When `y` gets accessed within `c()`, it has already the value `1` and R doesn't need to look it up any further. Therefore, the promise `y = 0` doesn't get evaluated.
   
   As `y` got assigned within `f1()`'s environment, the value of the global variable `y` stays untouched.

4. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: In `hist()`, the default value of `xlim` is `range(breaks)`, the default value for `breaks` is `"Sturges"`, and

    ```{r}
    range("Sturges")
    ```
    
   Explain how `hist()` works to get a correct `xlim` value.
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: The `xlim` argument of `hist()` is required to terminate the range of the histogram's x-axis. In order to provide a valid axis, `xlim` must contain a numeric vector of exactly two unique values. This holds at least, when the `plot` argument is set to `TRUE`, as otherwise no x-axis is needed. Therefore, when `xlim` is left as the default (`range(breaks)`), `breaks` must evaluate to a vector of at least two unique values. As the breakpoints for any histogram with at least one cell should suffice this condition, this requirement is consistent with our expectations. `hist()` technically achieves this by overwriting the `breaks` argument internally. As the `breaks` argument is quite flexible and allows the users to provide the breakpoints directly or compute them (or the related number of cells) in several ways, the detailled behaviour is quite specific to the input. However, via several internal checks, `hist()` ensures that `breaks` evaluates to a numeric vector containing at least two unique elements, before `xlim` gets accesed and evaluated and the final result of `hist()` is ready to be plotted.
   
5. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Explain why this function works. Why is it confusing?

    ```{r}
    show_time <- function(x = stop("Error!")) {
      stop <- function(...) Sys.time()
      print(x)
    }
    show_time()
    ```
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: Before `show_time()` accesses `x` (default `stop("Error")`), it overwrites the `stop()` function with `function(...) Sys.time()`. As default arguments are evaluated in the function environment, `x` gets evaluated as `Sys.time()`.
   
   `show_time()` is confusing, since its behaviour changes when `x`'s default value is supplied directly as it gets evalutad in the calling environment in this case.
  
    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    show_time(stop("Error"))
    ```

6. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: How many arguments are required when calling `library()`?

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: `library()` doesn't require any arguments. When called without arguments `library()` (invisibly) returns a list of class libraryIQR, containing a header and footer element as well as a results matrix, with one row and three columns per installed package. These columns contain entries for the name of the package ("Package"), the path to the package ("LibPath") and the title of the package ("Title"). `library()` also got its own print method (`print.libraryIQR`) which shows the information in its own window in the regarding development environment (i.e. RGui or RStudio).
   
   This behaviour is also documented under the details section of the help page for `library()` (see `?library`):
   
   > If library is called with no package or help argument, it lists all available packages in the libraries specified by lib.loc, and returns the corresponding information in an object of class “libraryIQR”. (The structure of this class may change in future versions.) Use .packages(all = TRUE) to obtain just the names of all available packages, and installed.packages() for even more information.
   
   However, since the `package` and `help` argument from `library()` do not show a default value, the possibility to call `library()` without arguments might be unnecessarily hard to spot for users during their first pass over the function.

    ```{r}
    str(formals(library))
    ```
    
   Instead of providing `NULL`s as default values, `library()` terminates internally via the `missing()` function, if the regarding arguments were supplied.

## `...` (dot-dot-dot)

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Explain the following results:
    
    ```{r}
    sum(1, 2, 3)
    mean(1, 2, 3)
    
    sum(1, 2, 3, na.omit = TRUE)
    mean(1, 2, 3, na.omit = TRUE)
    ```
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: The arguments of `sum()` are `...` and `na.rm`.
   
    ```{r}
    str(sum)
    ```
    
   For the `...` argument `sum()` expects numeric, complex or logical vector input (see `?sum`). A downside of `...` is that any misspelled arguments, like `na.omit` won't raise an error (when no further input checks are implemented). Instead, `na.omit` is treated as a logical element of the `...` argument, gets further coerced to `1` and used for summation. All other arguments are - of course - also part of the `...`. Therefore, `sum(1, 2, 3)` returns `6` and `sum(1, 2, 3, na.omit = TRUE)` returns `7`.
   
   In contrast, the generic function `mean()` expects `x`, `trim`, `na.rm` and `...` for its default method, `mean.default()`, which handles numeric and logical vector input for its `x` argument (see `?mean`).
   
    ```{r}
    str(mean.default)
    ```
   
   As `mean()` uses `...` and `na.omit` is none of `mean()`'s named arguments (and also not a candidate for partial matching), `no.omit` becomes - again - part of the `...` argument, which isn't used any further inside `mean.default()`. The other supplied objects are matched regarding their order, i.e.: `x = 1`, `trim = 2` and `na.rm = 3`. As `x` is of length 1 and not `NA`, the settings of `trim` and `na.rm` do not affect the calculation of the mean and both calls (`mean(1, 2, 3)` and `mean(1, 2, 3, na.omit = TRUE)`) return `1`.

2. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: In the following call, explain how to find the documentation for the named arguments in the following function call:
       
    ```{r, fig.asp = 1}
    plot(1:10, col = "red", pch = 20, xlab = "x", col.lab = "blue")
    ```
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: First we type `?plot` in the console and scan the usage section:
    
    ```
    plot(x, y, ...)
    ```
    
   Obviously we have to look under the `...` bullet in the arguments section.
    
   There we can find a bullet for `xlab` (check), and follow the recommendation to visit `?par` for further arguments. 
    
   From there we type "col" into the search bar, which leads us to a recommentation to search further under `Color Specification` (check). Again using the search we find a bullet for the `pch` argument. From there we get also the recommendation to look under `?points` for more specific settings (check). Finally we use the search functionality to find `col.lab` also as a bullet inside `?par`.
    
3. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Why does `plot(1:10, col = "red")` only colour the points, not the axes 
    or labels? Read the source code of `plot.default()` to find out.
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: It is easiest to start by adding `browser()` to the first line of `plot.default()` and interactively run `plot(1:10, col = "red")`. In this way we can see how the plot is build during the last lines and especially find out where the axis are added. This leads us to the function call:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    localTitle(main = main, sub = sub, xlab = xlab, ylab = ylab, ...)
    ```
    
   The `localTitle()` function was defined in the first lines of `plot.default()` as:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    localTitle <- function(..., col, bg, pch, cex, lty, lwd) title(...)
    ```
    
   So the call to `localTitle()` clearly gets the `col` parameter as part of `...` argument. To find out if it is used we try following the source code of `title()`, which leads us to a line of C code. Instead of following further, can we stay in R and look at `?title`, which brings some clarity on the fact that the `title()` function specifies four parts of the plot: Main (title of the plot), sub (sub-title of the plot) and both axis labels. Therefore it would introduce ambiguity inside `title()` to use `col` directly. Instead one has the option to supply `col` via the `...` argument as `col.labs` or as part of `xlab` (similar for `ylab`) in the form `xlab = list(c("index"), col = "red")`.

## Exiting a function

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What does `load()` return? Why don’t you normally see these values?

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: `load()` reloads datasets which were previously written to disk via the `save()` function. When run succesfully, `load()` invisibly returns a character vector, containing the names of the newly loaded objects. To print these names to the console, one can set the argument `verbose` to `TRUE` or surround the call in brackets to trigger R's autoprinting mechanism.
   
2. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What does `write.table()` return? What would be more useful?

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: `write.table()` writes its `x` object, usually a data frame or a matrix, to disk. It invisibly returns `NULL`. It would be more useful, if `write.table()` would (invisibly) return its `x` object. This would be useful to save intermediate results and directly take on further processing steps without breaking the flow of the code (i.e. breaking it into different lines). One package which uses this pattern is the readr package which is part of the so called tidyverse.
    
3. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: How does the `chdir` parameter of `source()` compare to `in_dir()`? Why might you prefer one approach to the other?

   The `in_dir()` approach was given in the book as
       
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    in_dir <- function(dir, code) {
      old <- setwd(dir)
      on.exit(setwd(old))
      
      force(code)
    }
    ```
    
   __<span style="color:orange">A</span>__: `in_dir()` takes a path to a working directory as an argument. At the beginning of the function the working directory is changed to this specification and with a call to `on.exit` it is guranteed, that when the function finishes the working directory also equals to this specification.
    
   In `source()` you need the `chdir` argument to specify, if the working directory should be changed during the evaluation to the `file` argument, if this is a pathname. The difference in `source()` is, that the actual working directory as output of `getwd()` is saved to set it in `on.exit` before changing the directory to the pathname (given to the `file` argument) for the rest of the execution of the `source()` function.

4. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Write a function that opens a graphics device, runs the supplied code, and closes the graphics device (always, regardless of whether or not the plotting code worked).  
   
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: To control the graphics device we use `pdf()` and `dev.off()`. To guarantee a clean termination `on.exit()` is used.
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    plot_pdf <- function(code){
      pdf("test.pdf")
      on.exit(dev.off())
      code
      }
    ```

5. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: We can use `on.exit()` to implement a simple version of `capture.output()`.

    ```{r}
    capture.output2 <- function(code) {
      temp <- tempfile()
      on.exit(file.remove(temp), add = TRUE)

      sink(temp)
      on.exit(sink(), add = TRUE)

      force(code)
      readLines(temp)
    }
    capture.output2(cat("a", "b", "c", sep = "\n"))
    ```
    
   Compare `capture.output()` to `capture.output2()`. How do the functions differ? What features have I removed to make the key ideas easier to see? How have I rewritten the key ideas to be easier to understand?
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: Using `body(capture.output)`, we can see the source code for the original `capture.output()` function. `capture.output()` is a good clip longer (39 lines vs. 7 lines). The reason for this is that `capture.output2()` is more modular, since `capture.output()` writes out entire methods like `readLines()` instead of invoking them. This makes `capture.output2` easier to understand if you understand the underlying methods.
    
   However, `capture.output2()` does remove potentially important functionality, as `capture.output()` appears to handle important exceptions not handled in `capture.output2()`, and `capture.output()` offers the ability to chose between overwriting or appending to a file.

## Function forms

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Rewrite the following code snippets into prefix form:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    1 + 2 + 3
    
    1 + (2 + 3)
    
    if (length(x) <= 5) x[[5]] else x[[n]]
    ```
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: In the following, we rewrite the expressions to match the exact syntax from above. Since prefix functions change the execution order in the same way as brackets do, we can omit the brackets in the second expression. Therefore, we provide the regarding alternative version as a comment.
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    `+`(`+`(1, 2), 3)
    
    `+`(1, `(`(`+`(2, 3)))  # `+`(1, `+`(2, 3))
    
    `if`(`<=`(length(x), 5), `[[`(x, 5), `[[`(x, n))
    ```

2. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Clarify the following list of odd function calls:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    x <- sample(replace = TRUE, 20, x = c(1:10, NA))
    y <- runif(min = 0, max = 1, 20)
    cor(m = "k", y = y, u = "p", x = x)
    ```  
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: Since none of these functions provides a `...` argument, we only need to consider, that function arguments are first machted exactly, then via partial matching and finally by position. This leads us to:
   
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    x <- sample(x = c(1:10, NA), size = 20, replace = TRUE)
    y <- runif(n = 20, min = 0, max = 1)
    cor(x = x, y = y, use = "pairwise.complete.obs", method = "pearson")
    ```
    
3. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Explain why the following code fails:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    modify(get("x"), 1) <- 10
    #> Error: target of assignment expands to non-language object
    ```
    
   __<span style="color:orange">A</span>__: First, let's define `x` and recall the definition of `modify()` from the textbook:
    
    ```{r}
    x <- 1:3
    
    `modify<-` <- function(x, position, value) {
      x[position] <- value
      x
    }
    ```
    
   As described in the textbook, R turns the code behind the scenes literally into
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    get("x") <- `modify<-`(get("x"), 1, 10)
    ```
    
   When we try to evaluate the code, R returns the same error message as above:
   
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    get("x") <- `modify<-`(get("x"), 1, 10)
    #> Error in get("x") <- `modify<-`(get("x"), 1, 10) : 
    #>   target of assignment expands to non-language object
    ```
    
   The error occures during the assignment, as no corresponding replacement function, i.e. `get<-` does exists for `get()`. To confirm this claim, we can reproduce the error via an easier example
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    get("x") <- 2
    #> Error in get("x") <- 2 : target of assignment expands to non-language object
    ```
    
   To improve the code, we can modify the example to use the `names()` function, which has a corresponding replacement function:
    
    ```{r}
    modify(names(x), 1) <- 10
    names(x)
    ```
    
4. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Create a replacement function that modifies a random location in a vector.
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: 

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    `random<-` <- function(x, value){
      x[sample(length(x), 1)] <- value
      x
      }
    ```

5. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Write your own version of `+` that will paste its inputs together if they are character vectors but behaves as usual otherwise. In other words, make this code work:
   
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    1 + 2
    #> [1] 3
    
    "a" + "b"
    #> [1] "ab"
    ```

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: We can simply override the `+` operator. In this case we need to take a bit of care to not use the `+` operator itself inside of the function definition, since otherwise we would end in an infinite recursion (a special case of an infinite loop). We also add `b = 0L` as a default value to keep the behaviour of `+` as a unary operator, i.e. to keep `+ 1` working and not throwing an error:
    
    ```{r}
    `+` <- function(a, b = 0L){
      if (is.character(a) && is.character(b)) {return(paste0(a, b))}
      a -- b
    }
    
    # tests
    + 1
    
    1 + 2
    
    "a" + "b"
    
    # return back to the original `+` operator behaviour
    rm(`+`)
    ```

6. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Create a list of all the replacement functions found in the base package. Which ones are primitive functions? (Hint use `apropos()`)
   
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: The hint suggests to look for functions with a specific naming pattern: Replacement functions conventionally end on `<-`. We can search these objects with a regular expression (`<-$`). 
   
   However, instead of `apropros()`we will use `ls()` and adopt a bit of the code from a previous exercise. (This makes it easier to work with environments explicitly.) From all the objects in the base package which end on `<-`, we subset the functions. Additionally, we also filter for primitive functions.
   
    ```{r}
    repl_objects <- mget(ls("package:base", all.names = TRUE, pattern = "<-$"),
                      inherits = TRUE)
    repl_functions <- Filter(is.function, repl_objects)
    length(repl_functions)
    ```
   
   Overall base R contains `r length(repl_functions)` replacement functions. The following `r length(Filter(is.primitive, repl_functions))` of them are also primitive functions:
   
    ```{r}
    names(Filter(is.primitive, repl_functions))
    ```

7. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What are valid names for user-created infix functions?  
  
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: Let's cite **Advanced R** here (section on "Function Forms"):
   
   > ... names of infix functions are more flexible than regular R functions: they can contain any sequence of characters except “%”.

8. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Create an infix `xor()` operator.
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: 

    ```{r}
    `%xor_%` <- function(a, b){
      (a | b) & !(a & b)
    }
    ```

9. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Create infix versions of the set functions `intersect()`, `union()`, and`setdiff()`. You might call them `%n%`, `%u%`, and `%/%` to match conventions from mathematics.
   
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: 
   
    ```{r}
    `%n%` <- function(a, b){
      unique(a[a %in% b])
    }

    `%u%` <- function(a, b){
      unique(c(a, b))
    }

    `%/%` <- function(a, b){
      a[!a %in% b]
    }
    ```
