## Environment basics

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: List three ways in which an environment differs from a list.

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: The most important differences between environments and lists are:
   - environments have reference semantics (i.e. they don't copy-on-modify).
   - environments have parents
   - the contents of an environment are not ordered
   - the contents of an environment must have unique names

2. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Create an environment as illustrated by this picture.

    ```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = NULL}
    knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/recursive-1.png", dpi = 300)
    ```
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: Let's create an environment, that contains itself.
    
    ```{r}
    e1 <- env()
    e1$loop <- e1
    ```

3. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Create a pair of environments as illustrated by this picture.

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
    knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/recursive-2.png", dpi = 300)
    ```
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: These two environments contain each other:
    
    ```{r}
    e1 <- env()
    e2 <- env()
    
    e1$loop   <- e2
    e2$dedoop <- e1
    ```

4. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Explain why `e[[1]]` and `e[c("a", "b")]` don't make sense when `e` is an environment.

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: The first option doesn't make sense, because elements of an environment are not ordered. The second option would return two objects at the same time. What data structure would they be contained inside?

5. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Create a version of `env_poke()` that will only bind new names, never re-bind old names. Some programming languages only do this, and are known as [single assignment languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_(computer_science)#Single_assignment).
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: We want `env_poke2()` to test, if the supplied name is already present in the given environment. We only allow new names to be assigned to a value, otherwise an (informative) error is thrown.

    ```{r, error=TRUE}
    env_poke2 <- function(env, name, value) {
      if (env_has(env, name)) {
        abort(paste0("\"", name, "\" is already assigned to a value."))
      }
      
      env_poke(env, name, value)
      invisible(env)
    }
    
    # Test
    env_1 <- env(a = 1)
    env_poke2(env_1, "b", 2)
    env_names(env_1)
    env_poke2(env_1, "b", 2)
    ```

6. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What does this function do? How does it differ from `<<-` and why might you prefer it?
   
    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    rebind <- function(name, value, env = caller_env()) {
      if (identical(env, empty_env())) {
        stop("Can't find `", name, "`", call. = FALSE)
      } else if (env_has(env, name)) {
        env_poke(env, name, value)
      } else {
        rebind(name, value, env_parent(env))
      }
    }
    rebind("a", 10)
    a <- 5
    rebind("a", 10)
    a
    ```  
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: The primary differnce between `rebind()` and `<<-` is that `rebind()` will only carry out an assignment when it finds an existing binding; unlike `<<-` it will never create a new one in the global environment. This is usually undesirable, because global variables introduce non-obvious dependencies between functions.
    
## Recursing over environments

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Modify `where()` to return all environments that contain a binding for `name`. Carefully think through what type of object the function will need to return.
   
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: The modified function will always recurse until it reaches the empty environment. Along the way, it will check each environment for a given `name`. Now it will return a list of environments where the binding was found; if no binding was found, the list will be empty. Please also note how the list is initialized via the default argument, when the function is called for the first time. This is a bit confusing, which is why it's common to wrap a recurisve function inside another, more user friendly, function.

    ```{r}
    where2 <- function(name, env = caller_env(), results = list()) {
      if (identical(env, empty_env())) {
        # Base case
        results
      } else {
        # Recursive case
        if (env_has(env, name)) {
          results <- c(results, env)
        }
        where2(name, env_parent(env), results)
      }
    }

    # Test
    e1a <- env(empty_env(), a = 1, b = 2)
    e1b <- env(e1a, b = 10, c = 11)
    e1c <- env(e1b, a = 12, d = 13)
    
    where2("a", e1c)
    ```

2. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Write a function called `fget()` that finds only function objects. It should have two arguments, `name` and `env`, and should obey the regular scoping rules for functions: if there's an object with a matching name that's not a function, look in the parent. For an added challenge, also add an `inherits` argument which controls whether the function recurses up the parents or only looks in one environment.

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: We follow a similar approach to the previous exercise. This time we additionally check if the found object is a function and implement and argument to turn off the recursion, if desired.
   
    ```{r}
    fget <- function(name, env = caller_env(), inherits = TRUE) {
      # Base case
      if (env_has(env, name)) {
        obj <- env_get(env, name)
        
        if (is.function(obj)) {
          return(obj)
        }
      }
      
      if (identical(env, emptyenv()) || !inherits) {
        stop("Could not find function called \"", name, "\"", call. = FALSE)
      }
      
      # Recursive Case
      fget(name, env_parent(env))
    }
    
    # Test
    mean <- 10
    fget("mean", inherits = TRUE)
    ```

## Special environments

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: How is `search_envs()` different fo `env_parents(global_env())`?

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: `search_envs()` returns all the environments on the search path. "The search path is a chain of environments containing exported functions of attached packages" (from `?search_envs`). Every time you attach a new package, this search path will grow. The search path ends with the base-environment. The global environment is included, because functions present in the global environment will always be part of the search path.

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    search_envs()
    #>  [[1]] $ <env: global>
    #>  [[2]] $ <env: package:rlang>
    #>  [[3]] $ <env: tools:rstudio>
    #>  [[4]] $ <env: package:stats>
    #>  [[5]] $ <env: package:graphics>
    #>  [[6]] $ <env: package:grDevices>
    #>  [[7]] $ <env: package:utils>
    #>  [[8]] $ <env: package:datasets>
    #>  [[9]] $ <env: package:methods>
    #> [[10]] $ <env: Autoloads>
    #> [[11]] $ <env: package:base>
    ```

   `env_parents(global_env())` will list all the ancestors of the global environment, therefore the global environment itself is not included. This also includes the "ultimate ancestor", the empty environment. This environment is not considered part of the search path because it contains no objects.

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    env_parents(global_env())
    #>  [[1]] $ <env: package:rlang>
    #>  [[2]] $ <env: tools:rstudio>
    #>  [[3]] $ <env: package:stats>
    #>  [[4]] $ <env: package:graphics>
    #>  [[5]] $ <env: package:grDevices>
    #>  [[6]] $ <env: package:utils>
    #>  [[7]] $ <env: package:datasets>
    #>  [[8]] $ <env: package:methods>
    #>  [[9]] $ <env: Autoloads>
    #> [[10]] $ <env: package:base>
    #> [[11]] $ <env: empty>
    ```

2. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Draw a diagram that shows the enclosing environments of this function:
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    f1 <- function(x1) {
      f2 <- function(x2) {
        f3 <- function(x3) {
          x1 + x2 + x3
        }
        f3(3)
      }
      f2(2)
    }
    f1(1)
    ```  
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: Each function environment binds its parent environment. The function environments contain functions and the values provided in the function call.
    
   <!-- HW: Looks good! -->

    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/function_environments.png", dpi = 96)
    ```
    
3. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Write an enhanced version of `str()` that provides more information about functions. Show where the function was found and what environment it was defined in.

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: To solve this problem, we need to write a function that takes the name of a function and looks for that function returning both the function and the environment that it was found in.

    ```{r}
    fget2 <- function(name, env = caller_env()) {
      # Base case
      if (env_has(env, name)) {
        obj <- env_get(env, name)
        
        if (is.function(obj)) {
          return(list(fun = obj, env = env))
        }
      }
      
      if (identical(env, emptyenv())) {
        stop("Could not find function called \"", name, "\"", call. = FALSE)
      }
      
      # Recursive Case
      fget2(name, env_parent(env))
    }
    
    fstr <- function(fun_name, env = caller_env()) {
      if (!is.character(fun_name) && length(fun_name) == 1) {
        stop("`fun_name` must be a string", call. = FALSE)
      }
      fun_env <- fget2(fun_name, env)
      
      list(
        where = fun_env$env,
        enclosing = fn_env(fun_env$fun)
      )
    }
    
    # Test
    fstr("mean")
    ```
    
   Once you have learned about tidyeval, you could rewrite `fstr()` to use `enquo()` so that you'd call it like more like `str()`, i.e. `fstr(sum)`.
    
## The call stack

<!-- HW: I really don't understand what the point of this question is -->
1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Write a function that lists all the variables defined in the environment in which it was called. It should return the same results as `ls()`.
   
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: We can implement this dynamic scoping behaviour, by explicitly referencing the caller environment. Please note, that this approach returns also variables starting with a dot, an option that `ls()` usually requires.
   
    ```{r}
    ls2 <- function(env = caller_env()) {
      env_names(env)
    }
    
    # Test in global environment
    ls(all.names = TRUE)
    ls2()
    
    # Test in "sandbox" environment
    e1 <- env(a = 1, b = 2)
    invoke(ls, .env = e1)
    invoke(ls2, .env = e1)
    ```
