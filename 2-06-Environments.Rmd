# Environments
    ```{r, include=FALSE}
    library(rlang)
    ```

## Environment basics

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: List three ways in which an environment differs from a list.

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: The most important differences between environments and lists are:
   - environments have reference semantics
   - environments have parents
   - environments are not ordered
   - elements of environments need to be (uniquely) named

2. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Create an environment as illustrated by this picture.

    ```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "400px"}
    knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/recursive-1.png", dpi = 300)
    ```
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: 
    
    ```{r}
    e1 <- env()
    e1$loop <- e1
    ```

3. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Create a pair of environments as illustrated by this picture.

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px"}
    knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/recursive-2.png", dpi = 300)
    ```
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: 
    
    ```{r}
    e1 <- env()
    e2 <- env()
    
    e1$loop   <- e2
    e2$dedoop <- e1
    ```

4. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Explain why `e[[1]]` and `e[c("a", "b")]` don't make sense when `e` is an environment.

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: The first option doesn't make sense, because elements of an environment are not ordered. The second option would return two objects at the same time without being contained in another data structure. Therefore, it would be unclear how R should handle this type of output.

5. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Create a version of `env_poke()` that will only bind new names, never re-bind old names. Some programming languages only do this, and are known as [single assignment languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_(computer_science)#Single_assignment).
    
   __<span style="color:red">A</span>__: We want `env_poke2()` to test, if the supplied name is already present in the given environment. We only allow new names to be assigned to a value, otherwise an (informative) error is thrown.

    ```{r, error=TRUE}
    env_poke2 <- function (env, nm, value){
      stopifnot(is_string(nm))
      current_names <- env_names(env)
      if (nm %in% current_names) {
        abort(paste0("\"", nm, "\" is already assigned to a value."))
      }
      else {
        assign(nm, value, envir = env)
      }
      invisible(env)
    }
    
    # Test
    env_1 <- env(a = 1)
    env_poke2(env_1, "b", 2)
    env_names(env_1)
    env_poke2(env_1, "b", 2)
    ```

6. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What does this function do? How does it differ from `<<-` and why might you prefer it?
   
    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    rebind <- function(name, value, env = caller_env()) {
      if (identical(env, empty_env())) {
        stop("Can't find `", name, "`", call. = FALSE)
      } else if (env_has(env, name)) {
        env_poke(env, name, value)
      } else {
        rebind(name, value, env_parent(env))
      }
    }
    rebind("a", 10)
    a <- 5
    rebind("a", 10)
    a
    ```  
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: The function does "more or less" the same as `<<-`. Additionally to `<<-` it has an `env` argument, but this is not a big advantage, since `assign()` also provides this functionality. The main difference is that `rebind()` only does an assignment, when it finds a binding in one of the parent environments of `env`. Whereas:
   
    > If `<<-` doesn't find an existing variable, it will create one in the global environment. This is usually undesirable, because global variables introduce non-obvious dependencies between functions.
    
## Recursing over environments

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Modify `where()` to return all environments that contain a binding for `name`. Carefully think through what type of object the function will need to return.
   
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: The modified function will always recurse until it reaches the empty environment. Along the way, it will check each environment for a given `name`. Only if no matching object is found in any environment, an error will be thrown. Otherwise the environments containing matching objects will be written to a *list*, which will be returned once the function terminates. Please also note how the list is initialized via the default argument, when the function is called for the first time.

    ```{r}
    where2 <- function(name, env = caller_env(), env_list = list()) {
      if (identical(env, empty_env())) {
        if (length(env_list)){
          # Final case
          return(env_list)
        } else {
          # Base case
          stop("Can't find ", name, call. = FALSE)
        }
      } else {
        if(env_has(env, name)){
          # Success case
          env_list <- c(env_list, env)
        }
        # Recursive case
        where2(name, env_parent(env), env_list)
      }
    }

    # Test
    e1a <- env(empty_env(), a = 1, b = 2)
    e1b <- env(e1a, b = 10, c = 11)
    e1c <- env(e1b, a = 12, d = 13)
    
    where2("a", e1c)
    ```

- initialize via default argument   
   
2. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Write a function called `fget()` that finds only function objects. It should have two arguments, `name` and `env`, and should obey the regular scoping rules for functions: if there's an object with a matching name that's not a function, look in the parent. For an added challenge, also add an `inherits` argument which controls whether the function recurses up the parents or only looks in one environment.

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: We can build up our function on the implementation of `get2()` in the last exercise. We only need to add a check via `is.function()`, change the name (also in the recursive call) and the error message:
   
    ```{r}
    fget2 <- function(name, env = parent.frame()){
      stopifnot(is.character(name), length(name) == 1)
      env <- pryr:::to_env(env)
      if (identical(env, emptyenv())) {
        stop("Could not find function called ", name, call. = FALSE) # 
        }
      # here we add the is.function() check
      if (exists(name, env, inherits = FALSE) && is.function(env[[name]])) {
        return(env[[name]])
        }
      else {
        fget2(name, parent.env(env))
      }
    }
    ```
    
   Note that this function is almost the same as the implementation of `pryr::fget()`:
    
    ```{r}
    pryr::fget
    ```
    
   We add an `inherits` parameter as described in the exercise:
    
    ```{r}
    fget3 <- function(name, env = parent.frame(), inherits = TRUE){
      stopifnot(is.character(name), length(name) == 1)
      env <- pryr:::to_env(env)
      if (identical(env, emptyenv())) {
        stop("Could not find function called ", name, call. = FALSE) 
        }
      if (exists(name, env, inherits = FALSE) && is.function(env[[name]])) {
        return(env[[name]])
        }
      # after the environment, which is specified in the env parameter, is checked
      # we stop our function in case the new inherits parameter is set to FALSE
      if (inherits == FALSE) {
        stop("Could not find function called ", name," within ",
             environmentName(env),
             call. = FALSE)
        }
      else {
        fget3(name, parent.env(env))
      }
    }
    ```

## Special environments

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: How is `search_envs()` different fo `env_parents(global_env())`?

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: `search_envs()` returns all the environments on the search path. "The search path is a chain of environments containing exported functions of attached packages" (from `?search_envs`). Every time you attach a new package, this search path will grow. The search path ends with the base-environment. The global environment is included, because functions present in the global environment will always be part of the search path.

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    search_envs()
    #>  [[1]] $ <env: global>
    #>  [[2]] $ <env: package:rlang>
    #>  [[3]] $ <env: tools:rstudio>
    #>  [[4]] $ <env: package:stats>
    #>  [[5]] $ <env: package:graphics>
    #>  [[6]] $ <env: package:grDevices>
    #>  [[7]] $ <env: package:utils>
    #>  [[8]] $ <env: package:datasets>
    #>  [[9]] $ <env: package:methods>
    #> [[10]] $ <env: Autoloads>
    #> [[11]] $ <env: package:base>
    ```

`env_parents(global_env())` will list all the ancestors of the global environment, therefore the global environment itsself is not included. This also includes the "ultimate ancestor", the empty environment. This environment is not part of the search path, because it contains no objects would need to be found.

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    env_parents(global_env())
    #>  [[1]] $ <env: package:rlang>
    #>  [[2]] $ <env: tools:rstudio>
    #>  [[3]] $ <env: package:stats>
    #>  [[4]] $ <env: package:graphics>
    #>  [[5]] $ <env: package:grDevices>
    #>  [[6]] $ <env: package:utils>
    #>  [[7]] $ <env: package:datasets>
    #>  [[8]] $ <env: package:methods>
    #>  [[9]] $ <env: Autoloads>
    #> [[10]] $ <env: package:base>
    #> [[11]] $ <env: empty>
    ```

2. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Draw a diagram that shows the enclosing environments of this function:
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    f1 <- function(x1) {
      f2 <- function(x2) {
        f3 <- function(x3) {
          x1 + x2 + x3
        }
        f3(3)
      }
      f2(2)
    }
    f1(1)
    ```  
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: Each function environment binds its parent environment. The function environments contain functions and the values provided in the function call.
    
   <!-- How I hope I understood this correctly! ;) (hb) -->

    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/function_environments.png", dpi = 96)
    ```
    
3. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Write an enhanced version of `str()` that provides more information about functions. Show where the function was found and what environment it was defined in.  
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: Additionally we provide the function type in the sense of `pryr::ftype`. We use functions from the `pryr` package, since it provides helpers for all requested features:
    
    ```{r}
    fstr <- function(object){
      if (!is.function(object)) {stop("fstr works only for functions")}
      
      object_str <- lazyeval::expr_text(object)
      
      flist <- list(ftype = pryr::ftype(object),
                 where = pryr::where(object_str),
                 enclosing_env = pryr::enclosing_env(object),
                 args = pryr::fun_args(object)
                 )
      
      return(flist)
    }
    ```
    
   Note that we wanted to have non standard evaluation like the original `str()` function. Since `pryr::where()` doesn't support non standard evaluation, we needed to catch the name of the supplied `object`. Therefore we used `expr_text()` from the [lazyeval](https://github.com/hadley/lazyeval) package. As a result, `fstr(object = packagename::functionname)` will result in an error in contrast to `str()`.

## The call stack

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Write a function that lists all the variables defined in the environment in which it was called. It should return the same results as `ls()`.
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: We can implement this dynamic scoping behaviour, by explicitly referencing the caller environment. Pleaso note, that this approach returns also variables starting with a dot - an option we also pass to `ls()`.

```{r}
ls2 <- function(env = caller_env()) {
  env_names(env)
}

# Test in global environment
ls(all.names = TRUE)
ls2()

# Test in "sandbox" environment
e1 <- env(a = 1, b = 2)
invoke(ls, .env = e1)
invoke(list_variables, .env = e1)
```
